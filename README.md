The code is dedicated only for QUT Motorsports usage. Code functionality is based on implementation of several people from different part of the world, refer to ACNOWLEDGEMNT.
## MCP2515 and 2517 CAN Messaging implementation
The code is meant to bring an understanding and set foundation for the first usage of Controller Area Network (CAN) bus protocol to exchange data. This particular one makes an example on a Teensy 2.0 and Rapberry Pi.

### MCP2515
Impments the CAN2.0 at 1 Megabit/second.
High speed SPI Interface (10MHz)

## Instructions
To get started with implementation, the UNIX based environment has to be created. Usage of Cygwin within Windows environment is acceptable. All OS has to have avr-gcc and relative libraries installed. Refer to SOWTWARE_REQUIREd.

Before implementation, hardware based settings has to be set for used language. Refer to Libs folder to identefy or correct pinouts for SPI signals.
NOTE that Raspberry Pi has only 2 CS pins for SPI needs. Refer to README_PI.md for configuration instructions.

## Build
### Requirements
Refer to INSTRUCTIONS.md to get all necessary instalations.
C version code:
```
make main
```
To build code and prepare for upload use run:
```
make build
```
Plug in Teensy and press RESET. When devices enters programming mode CL version of loader will upload

## Contributing
###### Contribution guide is dedicated for QUTMS members to implement.
Each assigned role has to be implemented within separate bracnh and kept as a separate release.
```
git clone git@github.com:QUT-Motorsport/QUTMS_CANSIM.git
```

```
git checkout -b SHUTDOWN
```

Performing changing within regular work process.
To update code with new changes from master perform merge within release branch.

```
git add . && git commit -b "MESSAGE"
git pull origin master
```
